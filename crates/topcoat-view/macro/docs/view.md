The [`view!`] macro is Topcoat's HTML templating syntax. It tries to be unsurprising by staying close to real HTML instead of inventing a Rust-shaped HTML dialect. That means:

- HTML elements use their real names.
- HTML void elements, such as `<br>`, `<hr>`, and `<img>`, are written without closing tags.
- Non-void elements need matching closing tags.
- Attribute names can use HTML separators like `-`, `:`, and `.`: `data-post-id`, `aria-label`, `xmlns:xlink`, `hx-get`, `class.active`.
- Rust keywords are still valid HTML attribute names, so `type="button"` and `for="email"` work as expected.

Unlike HTML however, text nodes must be quoted.

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
Ok(view! {
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="/app.css">
        </head>
        <body>
            <label for="email">"Email"</label>
            <input type="email" id="email" aria-label="Email address">
            <hr>
        </body>
    </html>
})
# }
```

Element names can use dashes, so custom elements fit naturally:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
Ok(view! {
    <my-widget data-widget-id="profile"></my-widget>
})
# }
```

# Rust Expressions

Use parentheses to interpolate a Rust expression into markup.

In child position, the expression becomes a node:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# struct User { name: &'static str }
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let user = User { name: "Ada" };
# let sidebar = view! { <aside></aside> };
Ok(view! {
    <h1>"Hello, " (user.name) "!"</h1>
    (sidebar)
})
# }
```

In attribute value position, the expression becomes the value:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let url = "/posts";
# let is_current = true;
Ok(view! {
    <a href=(url) aria-current=(is_current)>"Open"</a>
})
# }
```

The same parenthesized expression syntax can also be used for dynamic attribute names and dynamic element names:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
let tag = "section";
let attr = "data-state";

Ok(view! {
    <(tag) (attr)="ready">"Loaded"</(tag)>
})
# }
```

Due to a limitation in Rust macros, text nodes must be quoted:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let computed_text = "Computed";
Ok(view! {
    <p>"This is text"</p>
    <p>(computed_text)</p>
})
# }
```

# Control Flow

Control flow in [`view!`] is Rust control flow with markup bodies. The macro lowers these constructs into ordinary Rust statements that append to the view being built.

## `if`

Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to choose which markup is emitted.

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let user: Option<()> = None;
Ok(view! {
    if user.is_some() {
        <a href="/account">"Account"</a>
    } else {
        <a href="/login">"Sign in"</a>
    }
})
# }
```

In attributes, each branch emits attributes instead of child nodes:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let current = true;
Ok(view! {
    <a
        href="/posts"
        if current {
            aria-current="page"
            class="active"
        }
    >
        "Posts"
    </a>
})
# }
```

## `for`

Use `for pat in expr { ... }` to render the body once for each item.

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# struct Post { url: &'static str, title: &'static str }
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let posts = vec![Post { url: "/a", title: "A" }];
Ok(view! {
    <ul>
        for post in posts {
            <li>
                <a href=(post.url)>(post.title)</a>
            </li>
        }
    </ul>
})
# }
```

In attributes, a loop can emit zero or more attributes. This is useful when you already have attributes represented as data:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let attrs = vec![("data-id", "1")];
Ok(view! {
    <div
        for (name, value) in attrs {
            (name)=(value)
        }
    ></div>
})
# }
```

A loop is also how views built ahead of time render. One view interpolates in node position like any value, but a collection of views, such as a `Vec<BoxView>`, cannot: a node position holds one view, not a list of them. Loop over the collection and interpolate one view per iteration, and give component calls inside the loop a `key:` as described under Keys:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
let rows: Vec<BoxView> = vec![
    view! { <tr>"First"</tr> }.boxed(),
    view! { <tr>"Second"</tr> }.boxed(),
];

Ok(view! {
    <tbody>
        for row in rows {
            (row)
        }
    </tbody>
})
# }
```

## `match`

Use `match` to choose markup from patterns. Match arms can also use guards.

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# enum Status { Draft, Published { title: &'static str }, Archived }
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let status = Status::Draft;
# let show_archived = true;
Ok(view! {
    match status {
        Status::Draft => <span>"Draft"</span>,
        Status::Published { title } => <a href="/posts">(title)</a>,
        Status::Archived if show_archived => <span>"Archived"</span>,
        _ => "",
    }
})
# }
```

A match arm body is one view node. If a branch needs multiple sibling nodes, wrap them in a block:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# struct User { name: &'static str }
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let user: Option<User> = None;
Ok(view! {
    match user {
        Some(user) => {
            <h1>(user.name)</h1>
            <p>"Signed in"</p>
        },
        None => <a href="/login">"Sign in"</a>,
    }
})
# }
```

In attributes, each arm can emit attribute nodes:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# enum State { Open, Closed }
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let state = State::Open;
Ok(view! {
    <article
        match state {
            State::Open => class="open",
            State::Closed => aria-disabled="true",
        }
    ></article>
})
# }
```

## `let`

Use `let pat = expr;` to bind values for later nodes in the same body.

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# struct Post { title: &'static str, url: &'static str }
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let post = Post { title: " Hello ", url: "/hello" };
Ok(view! {
    <article>
        let title = post.title.trim();

        <h1>(title)</h1>
        <a href=(post.url)>"Read"</a>
    </article>
})
# }
```

The same works in an attribute list. The binding is in scope for attributes that follow it:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# struct Post { slug: &'static str, title: &'static str }
# impl Post { fn url(&self) -> &str { "/hello" } }
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let post = Post { slug: "hello", title: "Hello" };
Ok(view! {
    <a
        let href = post.url();
        href=(href)
        data-slug=(post.slug)
    >
        (post.title)
    </a>
})
# }
```

# Components

Components are called inside [`view!`] with a call syntax similar to functions. The macro introduces named parameters with the comma-separated `name: value` syntax to improve readability for components with many (optional) parameters. If the component has a `child` property, you may pass any number of view nodes at the end of parameter list. These do not need to be comma-separated:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn panel(title: &str, #[default] child: Child<'_>) -> Result<impl View> { Ok(view! { <section>(title)(child)</section> }) }
# #[component]
# async fn badge(label: &str, tone: &str) -> Result<impl View> { Ok(view! { <span>(label)(tone)</span> }) }
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
Ok(view! {
    panel(
        // Named title parameter:
        title: "Profile",
        // Child nodes:
        <p>"Account details"</p>
        badge(
            label: "Active",
            tone: "success",
        )
    )
})
# }
```

The child nodes desugar to:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn panel(title: &str, #[default] child: Child<'_>) -> Result<impl View> { Ok(view! { <section>(title)(child)</section> }) }
# #[component]
# async fn badge(label: &str, tone: &str) -> Result<impl View> { Ok(view! { <span>(label)(tone)</span> }) }
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
Ok(view! {
    panel(
        title: "Profile",
        // Named child parameter:
        child: view! {
            <p>"Account details"</p>
            badge(
                label: "Active",
                tone: "success",
            )
        }.into()
    )
})
# }
```

See how to define components in the [`component`] macro guide.

## Keys

Each component invocation receives a context with a stable identity derived from the chain of sites leading down to it in code, the same from one render to the next. The framework attaches per-invocation data such as state to it. A `for` loop repeats its body at the same site. Use `#[key(expr)]` on the loop to give each iteration its own identity, inherited by the components it invokes:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# struct Post { id: u64, title: &'static str }
# #[component]
# async fn post_card(title: &str) -> Result<impl View> { Ok(view! { <article>(title)</article> }) }
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let posts = vec![Post { id: 1, title: "A" }];
Ok(view! {
    #[key(post.id)]
    for post in posts {
        post_card(title: post.title)
    }
})
# }
```

The key expression is evaluated once per iteration and can use the loop's bindings. Choose a value that identifies the item, such as its database id, so identity follows the item when the list reorders. Any value implementing [`IdentityKey`] works as a key.

The attribute is optional. An unkeyed loop still renders, but its iteration identity is ambiguous. Consuming that identity through a component's context errors with the location of the loop missing its key. Nested keyed loops inherit ambiguity from an unkeyed outer loop.

Ordinary Rust expressions use the context explicitly passed to them. The macro does not rebind context variables inside loops. If a helper needs a distinct identity for each call, pass a context derived with [`Cx::keyed`](../context/struct.Cx.html#method.keyed), such as `helper(&cx.keyed(item.id))`.

# Views Are Lazy

A [`view!`] expression does not render where it is written. It evaluates to a value implementing [`View`], and the expressions inside run when that view renders: when it becomes a response, or when the view it is interpolated into does. A view that is never rendered never runs them, like a future that is never awaited.

A view value behaves exactly like an `async move` block, which is what the macro expands to. It captures every variable the template mentions by moving it into the view:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
let title = String::from("Hello");
let header = view! { <h1>(title)</h1> };

// `title` has moved into `header` and cannot be used here anymore.
Ok(view! {
    (header)
    <p>"Welcome!"</p>
})
# }
```

When a value is needed both inside the view and after it, interpolate a clone instead.

A view that captures a reference borrows whatever it points at, so it cannot outlive that data, exactly like an `async move` block. In practice this rarely gets in the way: component props and anything borrowed from the request context stay alive until the render is over, so they are safe to use in a view even when they are references, like a `&str` prop.

A view returned from a function may borrow the request context it was built against, since the context outlives the view; it can never borrow a local of the function itself. A template that mentions a borrow of a local variable, such as a `&str` alias or an iterator held in a variable, moves that borrow into the view, and returning the view then fails to compile because the borrow outlives the local. Mention the owned value instead, or clone it into the view:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, context::Cx, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn page(cx: &Cx) -> Result<impl View> {
let title = String::from("Dashboard");

// Does not compile: the view captures the borrow, and outlives the local:
// let label: &str = &title;
// Ok(view! { <h1>(label)</h1> })

// The view owns the value, so it can be returned:
Ok(view! { <h1>(title)</h1> })
# }
```

# Concurrent Rendering

The components inside a [`view!`] render concurrently. Sibling components, the iterations of a `for` loop, the taken branch of an `if` or `match` all start at the same time. A component waiting on a database query or an HTTP request therefore does not hold up the rest of the view, which avoids request waterfalls.

The rendered markup always appears in source order, no matter which component finishes first. The order in which component bodies and template expressions run is unspecified and can change between renders.

Treat component bodies and template expressions as computations without side effects. Do not rely on another component or expression in the same view having run first, and do not communicate through shared mutable state. If work needs to happen in a particular order, perform it before constructing the view and interpolate the resulting values.

# Boolean And Conditional Attributes

[Boolean HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean/HTML) such as `disabled`, `required`, and `checked` are true when the attribute is present and false when it is absent. HTML expects a present boolean attribute to have an empty value.

When the value is known where the view is written, prefer the literal form `disabled=""` over the expression form `disabled=(true)`. Both render as `disabled=""`, but the literal is static markup that the macro folds into the pre-rendered parts of the template, while `(true)` is a Rust expression evaluated on every render.

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
Ok(view! {
    <input type="email" required="" disabled="">
})
# }
```

When the value is only known at run time, pass an expression. Expression attributes can remove themselves from the rendered markup: when the value evaluates to [`false`] or [`None`], the whole attribute is omitted, while a [`true`] value renders the attribute with an empty value. A [`bool`] expression therefore gives a boolean attribute exactly the presence behavior HTML expects, and [`Some`]/[`None`] extend the same logic to attributes that carry values:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
let is_disabled = false;
let is_current = true;
let maybe_title: Option<&str> = None;

Ok(view! {
    <button
        disabled=(is_disabled)
        aria-current=(is_current.then_some("page"))
        title=(maybe_title)
    >
        "Save"
    </button>
})
# }
```

The rendered opening tag includes `aria-current="page"`, but leaves out `disabled` and `title` completely.

This omission logic applies to expression attributes. Literal attributes are always present:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
Ok(view! {
    <button disabled="false">"Still disabled in HTML"</button>
})
# }
```

Attributes that take the literal strings `"true"` and `"false"` as values, such as `aria-expanded` or `contenteditable`, are enumerated attributes, not boolean attributes. For them, `"false"` means something different than omitting the attribute, so pass strings instead of booleans:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
# let expanded = false;
Ok(view! {
    <button aria-expanded=(if expanded { "true" } else { "false" })>"Menu"</button>
})
# }
```

# Attribute Collections And Class Lists

Two companion macros build attribute values outside a view:

- [`attributes!`] uses the same attribute syntax as [`view!`] to build a reusable [`topcoat::view::Attributes`] collection that inserts into an element as an attribute fragment.
- [`class!`] assembles a `class` attribute value from static and conditional entries into a [`topcoat::view::Class`], which joins its entries with single spaces and omits the attribute entirely when no entry is present.

# Status Codes And Response Headers

A view can declare the status code and headers of the HTTP response it renders into. A [`StatusCode`] in node position sets the response status, and a [`HeaderMap`] or a single `(HeaderName, HeaderValue)` pair adds response headers. None of them render any content.

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# use topcoat::router::{StatusCode, HeaderValue, header};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
Ok(view! {
    (StatusCode::NOT_FOUND)
    ((header::CACHE_CONTROL, HeaderValue::from_static("no-store")))
    <h1>"Page not found"</h1>
})
# }
```

Competing declarations resolve by render order: the first status code rendered wins, and for each header name the first part that mentions it provides all of that name's values. Placement therefore decides precedence between a layout and the pages it wraps. A declaration placed before the layout's slot overrides whatever the page declares; placed after the slot it is a fallback the page can override:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# use topcoat::router::{HeaderValue, Slot, header, layout};
#[layout("/docs")]
async fn docs_layout(slot: Slot<'_>) -> Result<impl View> {
    Ok(view! {
        <main>(slot)</main>
        ((header::CACHE_CONTROL, HeaderValue::from_static("max-age=60")))
    })
}
```

Every page under `/docs` now gets `Cache-Control: max-age=60` unless it declares its own `Cache-Control`.

A status code in node position never renders text. To display one, render one of its accessors instead, such as `(status.as_u16())`.

These declarations require the `router` feature (or the `topcoat-view` crate's `http` feature) and take effect when the rendered view becomes a response; rendering a view to a plain string discards them.

# Rendering Outside A Component

Inside a [`component`], `#[page]`, `#[layout]`, or `#[shard]`, the request context is in scope implicitly, so `view!` can render components and reactive markup with no ceremony. In a plain function you pass the context explicitly at the start of the `view!` macro:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, context::Cx, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn greeting(name: &str) -> Result<impl View> { Ok(view! { <h1>(name)</h1> }) }
async fn render(cx: &Cx) -> Result<impl View> {
    Ok(view! { cx => greeting(name: "World") })
}
```

Whether it names its context or not, a view resolves to self-contained content when it is the outermost view of a render, so it can become a response on its own, and takes part in the enclosing render when it is interpolated into another view.

# Custom Values In Markup

The macro accepts dynamic Rust values by routing them through small runtime traits. Implement the trait for the position where your type should be accepted:

- [`NodeViewParts`] for values used as child nodes: `(value)`.
- [`AttributeValueViewParts`] for values used as attribute values: `name=(value)`.
- [`AttributeKeyViewParts`] for values used as dynamic attribute names: `(name)="value"`.
- [`AttributeViewParts`] for values that emit one or more full attributes in APIs that accept complete attribute fragments.
- [`ElementNameViewParts`] for values used as dynamic element names: `<(name)>...</(name)>`.

Each trait method receives a [`PartsWriter`] for the position being filled. Everything pushed through its `push_*` methods is escaped or validated for that position when the view renders; the `push_*_unescaped` methods are the only opt-out and must only be given trusted markup.

For example, a type can opt into child-node rendering by implementing [`NodeViewParts`]:

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
use topcoat::{context::Cx, view::{NodeViewParts, PartsWriter}};

struct Badge(String);

impl NodeViewParts for Badge {
    fn into_view_parts(self, _cx: &Cx, parts: &mut PartsWriter<'_>) {
        parts.push_string(self.0);
    }
}

Ok(view! {
    <p>(Badge("New".to_owned()))</p>
})
# }
```

For attribute values, implement [`AttributeValueViewParts`]. Its [`attribute_present`][AttributeValueViewParts::attribute_present] method controls whether the containing attribute is rendered at all.

```rust
# use topcoat::{Result, view::*};
# #[component]
# async fn example() -> Result<impl View> {
use topcoat::{context::Cx, view::{AttributeValueViewParts, PartsWriter}};

struct DataId(Option<String>);

impl AttributeValueViewParts for DataId {
    fn attribute_present(&self) -> bool {
        self.0.is_some()
    }

    fn into_view_parts(self, _cx: &Cx, parts: &mut PartsWriter<'_>) {
        if let Some(value) = self.0 {
            parts.push_string(value);
        }
    }
}

Ok(view! {
    <article data-id=(DataId(Some("post-1".to_owned())))></article>
})
# }
